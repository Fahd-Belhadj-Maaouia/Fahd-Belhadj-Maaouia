## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fahd Belhadj Maaouia, a 21-year-old Tunisian student, hustler, and dreamer. I've explored many things in life before taking a bold leap into Computer Science. Plot twist? Maybe. Worth it? Definitely.

I'm currently studying at the Private Higher School of Engineering and Technology (ESPRIT), where I'm soaking up everything I can about tech and innovation.

- ðŸ”­ Working on projects I hope will *skyrocket* my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Learning web dev, mobile dev, and data engineering
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on meaningful apps that solve real problems
- ðŸ¤” Always open to tips and tricks only *real* devs know
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my PC â€” itâ€™s basically my second brain
- ðŸ“« Reach me at: Fahd.bhm360@gmail.com or Fahd.belhadjmaaouia@esprit.tn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once ate ants. Don't ask. (Or do...)
